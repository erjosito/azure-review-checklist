# Azure Review Checklists

When doing Azure design reviews (or any review for that matter), Excel spreadsheets are often the medium of choice. The problem is that those spreadsheets are not easily made subject to revision control, and collaboration with branches, pull requests, reviews and others is difficult at best, impossible in most of the cases.

This repo will showcase the idea of having a markdown version of the checklist, that can be imported into an Excel spreadsheet by means of Visual Studio Code.
